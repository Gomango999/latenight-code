# Introduction

---

Welcome to Moonlit Code, my personal blog where I write about all my adventures in computer science!

My name is Kevin Zhu, and I'm a uni student at UNSW doing Bachelor of Science (Advanced Mathematics)(Honours)/Science (Computer Science). My current passions include AI/ML as well as competitive programming.

This site was made as in my personal time to learn some more about web development, and to give me the tools to make my own products if I ever choose to go entrepreneurial. In the mean time, I'll be posting competitive programming techniques and writeups, as well as any other random tidbits I pick up on my journey in computer science.

Enjoy your stay!
