How to make your own minecraft skin.
So this content is going to be a little different from normal...
I'm going to be making my very own Minecraft skin tutorial! Here's the deal:

Start by showing the final product!
- Image of final product
<div class="centering w-100 my-4">
![_The finished skin!_](/blog_posts/26_minecraft_skin/images/editor.png){width=50%}
</div>

## Planning

Every good piece of artwork (or any project in general) starts with a PLAN
Start by finding reference for your art

- Show some sample images

Making flats. This lets you choose your colours. Choosing colours, and using contrast to emphasise focal points

- Software for editting (GIMP)
- Show example image

This part is pretty boring, so we can skip over it pretty quickly

## Details

Using layers for a 3D effect. Minecraft is pretty blocky, you so you gotta add detail where you can

- This part is super fun!
- Show how you can make a sphere
- Show how I used it in the hair and shoulders to make it more 3D
- Show how you can use it for detail (knots, bandage, knee caps, rope, hair)

Painting techniques
- Smudge tool is your friend!
- Shadows should be more saturated.
