# Heya!
Welcome to Midnight Code, my personal blog where I write about all my adventures in computer science!

My name is Kevin Zhu, and I'm a uni student at UNSW doing Bachelor of Science (Advanced Mathematics)(Honours)/Science (Computer Science). I work at a blockchain startup company, as well as teach informatics at my old high school.

Some of my (highly degenerate) hobbies include
- Playing games (currently Overwatch)
- Japanese cartoons
- Making pixel art
- and Competitive Programming

This site was made as in my personal time to learn some more about web development, and to give me the tools to make my own products if I ever choose to go entrepreneurial. In the mean time, I'll be posting competitive programming techniques and writeups, as well as any other random tidbits I pick up from my everlasting career into computer science.

Enjoy your stay!
