<p> Just do it lul. Ez Problem. </p>
<p> One strategy is to always assign the first vase 1 flower, the second vase 2 flowers, and the last vase all the remaining flowers. Provided that we have at least 3 flowers to put into the final vase, this ensures that all the vases have different numbers (rule 3), all flowers are placed in a vase (rule 1), and no vases are empty (rule 2).</p>
<p> Now, if we do not have at least 3 flowers left after filling vases 1 and 2, then that means we had less than 6 flowers to begin with. With a bit of trial and error, we can see that there is no way to place less than 6 flowers into the vases such that we satisfy all three rules. Hence, we can safely say that it is impossible if we have less than 6 flowers, and print 0 0 0</p>
