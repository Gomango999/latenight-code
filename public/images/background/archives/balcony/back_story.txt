Lifen is 26, single, female, Chinese.

She lives in a small cramped apartment in NYC.
She has just moved in to her new apartment a few days ago, and is slowly beginning to settle in. 
It is the first time she is living without parents.

Lifen is a freelance front end designer, who works from home.
She has a keen eye for design and fashion.
She makes a decent income, but she does not buy expensive things. She prefers a minimalist design instead.
She has taken on many Americanised design trends, but is still inspired by traditional chinese art.
She keeps her apartment messy, but in a cozy and clean sort of way

Lifen does not have too many friends, as she has only just moved to America to pursue her career,
but she keeps in close contact with the ones she has.
She often likes to send pictures of her new life in America to family and friends.
Some nights, she likes to stay up and work to the sound of the city at night.

Lifen likes tea, bass guitar and night time.

Lifen's apartment is very small, so she prefers to work outside. Things she keeps outside with her are:
- a cup of tea (on a coaster)
