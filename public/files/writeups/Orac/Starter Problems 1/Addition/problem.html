<p> Your task here is a straight-forward one: you are to write a program that takes two numbers and adds them together. Luckily, computers are built for adding numbers together and will do all the calculation for you - all you need to do is write code that will correctly read from and write to the text files.

<h2>Input</h2>
The input file will consist of the two integers a and b separated by a single space. It is guaranteed that 0 <= a, b <= 1,000,000,000.

<h2>Output</h2>
Your output file should consist of a single integer, the sum of a and b.

<h2>Sample Input</h2>
<pre>23 45</pre>

<h2>Sample Output</h2>
<pre>68</pre>
