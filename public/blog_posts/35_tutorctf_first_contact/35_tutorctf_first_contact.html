<p>We receive an alien message, containing a single wav file. Listening to it, it sounds like mjust a bunch of random beeps. Let’s open this up in an audio viewer such as audacity:</p>

<p>As we can see, there a bunch of spikes in audio. I originally thought this might be binary, but there were some spiikes which seemed in between a 1 and a 0, so it was difficult to fully translate. Not to mention that some were in groups of 5, others were in groups of 4 and 3, so binary didn’t seem like the best fit.</p>
<p>The next thing we can try is the spectogram view. The spectogram view of some audio is shows us how energy in different frequency bands change over time. In a typical audio file, the spectrogram may look like this:</p>

<p>But by manipulating the soundwaves, we can actually make this spectrogram look however we want. Turning it on in audacity gives us the flag:</p>
