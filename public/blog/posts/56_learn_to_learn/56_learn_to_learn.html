<h3 id="so-i-hit-platinum-in-overwatch">So I hit Platinum in
Overwatch</h3>
<p>I know this is a bit out of left field. Your reaction is probably
“who the f*ck cares?“. And rightfully so, but bear with me for a minute.
For those not familiar, platinum isn’t a particularly impressive rank,
at roughly the 60th percentile. It’s literally just the average rank of
the playerbase. Hell, it’s not even the first time I’ve hit plat before.
So what makes this time so special? And why am I even talking about it
on a blog dedicated to programming? Let me share a little story.</p>
<p>In 2016, Overwatch was released. It was a game that was truly
special. While clearly taking inspiration from some of it’s
predecessors, it improved on almost every aspect of gameplay, with
beautiful looking graphics that somehow ran on even the most low-end of
PCs, all packaged into 21 fun and zany heroes to pick between. There was
truly something for everyone, and I was instantly hooked. Over the
years, Overwatch would end up going through many controversies, from
scandals at Blizzard, the content drought that lasted multiple years, to
the cancellation of the highly anticipated PvE but my love for the game
never died out. The base game was fun, and that was good enough for me.
None of that would ever change for me.</p>
<p>There was however, one problem. I was in gold. Not just that, I was
hard stuck. At this point, I had put close to 500 hours in but somehow I
could never find the way to get out of gold. Sure I did actually reach
plat a couple of times. But it was always seemingly because I was
playing with better friends and we’d found ourselves a massive winning
streak, either that or I would barely graze plat and immediately go on a
massive losing streak that sent me to the bottom of gold once again. And
it wasn’t for a lack of trying either. I wasn’t just playing casually, I
was having dicussions with mates about what strategies worked and what
didn’t. I was looking up guides and learning the nuances of hero
interactions. I was sitting down and reviewing my games, but no matter
what I did, nothing seemed to stick and I could never consistently get
out of Gold. All this while I could see the people around me
progressively getting better at the game, and not just hitting plat but
the ranks above that.</p>
<h3 id="the-seed-of-doubt">The Seed of Doubt</h3>
<p>Now you might be thinking something to the effect of “Welp, you’ve
tried your best, but you can’t be good at everything. There are plenty
of other things I’m sure you could work on” and at the time, I thought
the exact same thing. Overwatch just wasn’t for me, and it’d be
something that I’d never be good at. And that was fine. I would play on
and off over and over again and everything was fine. That’s what I told
myself, but the truth was was that it was always a chip on my shoulder
that I held onto for years. Not enough to effect my day to day life, but
enough to cast this seed of doubt in my mind. “There are things that for
others seem easy, that I can truly try my best in that I couldn’t even
get to an average level in”. It genuinely bugged me, my personality is
just like that. It was small but insiduous, and as I slowly found more
things that I wasn’t able to do well despite trying, the seed blossomed
in a way I might have not have liked it to.</p>
<h3 id="overcoming-the-fear">Overcoming the Fear</h3>
<p>Recently though, I’d been reflecting alot on the way I learnt things.
I wanted to get better at programming, but not only that, I wanted to
get better at learning in general. This lead me down a path of
information gathering and introspection, and along the journey, I
thought to myself “why not give getting good at Overwatch one more
try?”. I felt as though I had some new tools that would make this
attempt a little bit better. And so I started grinding the game once
again. This time though, equipped with new knowledge, I changed several
things about the way I played. And surprisingly, it worked. Within 2
months, I’d hit plat twice more. However, for the first time in almost 8
years, I felt like I had done it in a way where I was truly deserving of
the rank. Instead of having no clue what I had done to get me there, I
could point to specific things and changes to my gameplay and learning
style that had gotten me there. Instead of the constant fear that I
would fall out again if I let up the hard work, I was confident that if
I were to fall out again, I would be able to make it back again just as
easily. I think it was at this point that I had truly hit plat for the
first time.</p>
<p>So what did I do differently this time? That’s what I want to bring
to you in today’s post. I’ll be listing a few things that I did that
helped me to rank up. And not just get the rank I wanted, but in a way
that was sustainable and restored some confidence in my ability to… well
learn. While I guess you could just look at this through the lens of
Overwatch, my goal is to share insight that can be applied to almost any
discipline that you might want to improve in, and to that effect, though
I sometimes do refer to my ranking up experience, I’ve tried my best
some of my other interests as examples of how this can be applied to
really almost anything in your life, from sports, relationships, work,
or creative endeavours.</p>
<h3 id="the-three-areas">The Three Areas</h3>
<p>Anyways, with that long intro out of the way, I ultimately wanted to
highlight 3 key areas that I found had a significant effect on my
learning:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Consistency</li>
<li>Systems</li>
<li>Reflection</li>
</ol>
<p>Over the course of the next three posts, I’ll be unpacking each one
of these. I’ll teach you what they are, why they are so important to
understand, and hopefully provide some actionable steps that you can
take to apply them to your life. Despite the opening story of this post,
this is all advice that I’ve applied to other areas of my life not just
in gaming, but from programming, sports, and art, and it’s my hope that
you can find use for this as well.</p>
<p>I also want to be perfectly clear that I have not completed this
journey. Not by a long shot, and perhaps some of my takeaways may change
as I keep going. That being said, I feel comfortable enough sharing my
progress so far. Think about as my story rather than a set of
instructions from a well learned authroity if that helps. The hope is
that this series can resonate with someone like me, who has doubted
their ability to do anything. Though I can’t guarantee I’ll change that,
I can at least share my own story. If even one person might find the
information even halfway useful, I’d consider this a win.</p>
<h3 id="inspirations">Inspirations</h3>
<p>These are all areas which I spent a significant amount of time
reading and thinking about. After so much time spent, I think I was able
to extract some useful information that I’d like to share. Though I have
taken advice from a whole host of educators (and perhaps people who
wouldn’t even consider themselves educators in the first place) in many
different fields that I am interested in, I’d like to give particular
credit to a small fraction of them who influenced this blog, though
please be aware that I wouldn’t be able to fit everyone who inspired me
in here as the list would quickly grow out of hand.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/HealthyGamerGG">Healthy Gamer /
Dr K.</a>
<ul>
<li>A channel focused around mental health. Despite the name, the
channel consistently covers topics from everyday life unrelated to
gaming. I find Dr K. to be a highly empathetic person, and he covers
plenty of problems that millions of people struggle with, such as
brainrot, procrastination, focus, relationships and almost anything else
you could ever want. His explanations are simple, and he gives short
actionable steps if you ever find yourself in seemingly impossible
situations. I can’t recommend this channel enough.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">Atomic Habits - James
Clear</a>
<ul>
<li>This is probably one of the most recommended books in the western
hemisphere, but honestly for good reason. There’s fantastic advice
packed from cover to cover unpacking why we seem to be able to stick to
certain undesirable habits just fine, whilst seemingly doing everything
we can to avoid the good ones. It’s filled with interesting stories,
examples of successful people applying the exact same strategies to
reach their goals, and honestly in some way influenced the writing style
of this blog as well. This book should honestly be required reading for
all students.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JustinSung">Justin Sung</a>
<ul>
<li>Though I sometimes find that he uses too much time introducing and
motivating concepts rather than explainly plainly how can use them, I
still found useful information here to do with how the mind processes
information. His talks about encoding and retaining information were
particularly helpful in rethinking the way I take in information. If
you’ve ever felt something along the lines of “I’m just more stupid than
others, my mind is less able to retain information compared to others”,
I’d recommend giving this channel a watch.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Awkward2">Awkward</a>
<ul>
<li>Awkward is a grandmaster in overwatch who makes educational videos
where he ranks up from unranked to GM on different heroes. Though the
smurfing is controversial, I think he offers education in a way that few
content creators do. Many GMs when doing similar challenges fall into
the trap of explaining their entire thought process, the problem being
that their thought process is optimised for performing well in GM.
Awkward was not only helpful in my climb out of gold, but was also a
great example of how simple and effective education can be. Also a quick
shoutout for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CoachSpilo">Spilo</a>, a
coach who serves a more analytical side of Overwatch in an equally
digestible way, who also helped in my climb.</li>

<!-- TODO: Ended up much more focused on learning in general, without much of an overwatch focus. Change this to reflect -->
<!-- - Consistency
    - In mechanics
        - Aim training
    - In mood 
        - Voice chat
        - Expectations of team
        - Expectations for yourself

- Systems
    - Be specific
    - Trigger -> Action 

- Reflections
    - Reflect after every game
    - Spend a couple minutes after every game
        - Not an hour though.
        - Just enough to be a little bit more than the average player.
    - Read on previous reflections. 
    - Time spent thinking 
    - Spaced repetition
