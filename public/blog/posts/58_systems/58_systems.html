<p>In the previous blog post, we talked about consistency. One of the
things I mentioned was that you could gain consistency by having a
system in place for when you feel like things aren’t going well. But
what exactly is a system? And how do we go about making one? That’s the
question I’d like to answer in todays’ blog post.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-system">What is a System?</h3>
<p>A system is essentially what it looks like if you were to write down
the exact flowchart of actions you take on a moment to moment basis as
you engage in a skill or activity. These should be written down and
essentially give a step by step on how to complete every task that you
need to do. You can have multiple different systems for different
aspects of the same activity. For example if it were drawing, perhaps
you might have a system for each stage of the process, i.e. planning
composition, lineart, rendering, and effects.</p>
<p>As an example, here is a simple system I came up with for exploring
new codebases recently. You don’t have to follow the exact same
formating and structure that I do. I’ll talk later about what makes a
good system so that you can make your own. As with most things, the best
way to do something is the one that works for you.</p>

<h3 id="why-are-systems-good">Why are systems good?</h3>
<p>Systems are great for a many reasons. As we’ve talked about before,
systems are a rock solid fallback that you can always rely on to get
<em>some</em> results. The goal is not for your system to represent what
your top performance looks like. Instead, on the days that you feel that
you are underperforming, the system gives you something that you can
always anchor yourself on to get a guranteed 60-70% of the results. Even
seemingly abstract concepts, like “coming up with an idea for an
illustration” can be systemised.</p>
<p>Another reason that systems are great is because they allow you to
iterate. You don’t have to start off with a perfect system, recall the
20-80 rule. 20% of the effort gets you 80% of the reuslts. As you learn
more and your understanding deepens, you can slowly update your system
until it gets closer and closer to an ideal. But of course, this is only
possible if you have some sort of standardised procedure as your
baseline. If you always just “make it up as you go”, you may find that
when it comes time to reflect on and improve your process, you either
don’t have anywhere to start, or whatever change you make ends up
becoming unusable the next time you work because your process has
changed.</p>
<p>Thirdly, written systems are a way to remind you what you are
currently working on. Taking the coding flowchart I shared above as an
example, though I technically have the knowledge (I wrote the thing,
afterall!), there is no way that I could possibly keep the entirety of
it just in my head while diving into the code. Once I’ve written it
down, the system is something that I can review before the start of
every code reading session, to help reinforce the lessons I’ve learnt.
This is point is so interesting in fact, that I’d like to actually take
the time to talk briefly about the Adult Learning Model, and how having
a system complements this way of thinking.</p>
<h3 id="the-adult-learning-model">The Adult Learning Model</h3>
<p>There is a concept in learning theory called the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence"><strong>Adult
Learning Model</strong></a>. It defines the four stages of learning
things, but for the purposes of this article, we’ll only focus on the
last two stages: <strong>Conscious Competence</strong> and
<strong>Unconcious Competence</strong>. If you’d like to read more,
there is a <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/ht2otf/gamers_guide_to_tilt_what_is_tilt_how_and_why/">fantastic
reddit writeup</a> that is definitely worth a read. It’s written in a
gaming context and focuses on tilt, but applies to any situtation in
life where you feel like emotions are getting in the way of your
decision making.</p>

Competence</figcaption>
</figure>
</center>
<p>Back on track though, level 3 of the adult learning model is
conscious confidence. It is a level of skill where you technically know
how to perform each task, but every action takes some conscious thought.
To take an example from the reddit post, imagine you are learning to
play tennis. You have a understanding of how to hold you raquet, how to
serve, how to position during play etc. However, all of these require
your concentration, and sometimes, if you need to apply too many of them
at once, you might mess up.</p>
<p>The next level up, level 4, is the unconscious confidence. At this
stage, you’ve put many years into the sport, until the point where you
can do all these things effortlessly. You no longer have to think about
how to grip the handle for a specific type of shot. It’s been drilled
into you so many times that you can do it without even thinking. At this
stage in learning, because you no longer need to focus on those skills,
you can now focus on other skills, such as tricky dropshots, squeezing
out more power from your smashes, opponent positioning etc.</p>
<p>There are two things to understand about this model. Firstly, the way
we transfer a skill from level 3 into level 4 is one thing: practice.
Secondly, there is a limited amount of space in your brain to focus on
level 3 skills. If you’ve ever heard the advice to “focus on just one
thing at a time”, this is what that means. If you try to focus on too
many level 3 skills at once, your brain will simply eject other skills
to make space, and you’ll end up messing up the fundamentals and feeling
overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Why have I brought this up? Well firstly, it’s a a fantastic mental
model for how we should approach learning. But secondly, the idea is for
our system is to complement this learning process. To put it simply,
<em>the system represents our current level 3 skills that we are trying
to internalise</em>. Since they are currently in level 3, we can easily
forget if we’re not putting in conscious thought into them. But by
having them written down in a simple to follow way and reviewing them
semi-regularly, we can train ourselves over time to recall this
information effortlessly. As we learn, you may find that there are
skills that you have fully acclimated, and thus are less important to
keep in your system. Similarly, as we learn, we might find a new skill
that we would like to polishing, and thus we add this to our system.
Essentially, having a written system works very well with how we
understand humans learn and internalise new information.</p>
<h3 id="what-makes-a-good-system">What Makes a Good System?</h3>
<p>As I mentioned before, you should make a system that works for you.
But what makes a good system? Here are some pointers that I’ve come up
with:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Systems should be organic</strong>
<ul>
<li>You might have gotten the sense of this already, but systems change
over time, as you learn more and more things.</li>
<li>As you pick up new skills or your understanding deepens, you can add
to and iterate on the current system you have.</li>
<li>As you commit skills to memory, to the point where you don’t even
need to think about them anymore, then you can prune them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Systems are short and simple</strong>
<ul>
<li>If a system becomes too complex, then your brain literally cannot
keep it all in your head at once.</li>
<li>Use simple language</li>
<li>Dot points are your friend</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Use Triggers and Actions</strong>
<ul>
<li>Imagine you show up at the grocery store, and lo and behold, you’ve
forgotten your wallet. “I’ll make sure to bring my wallet next time” you
tell yourself. This is an effective strategy… right up until the next
time you’re standing in queue and realised that you’ve forgotten it
again.</li>
<li>The lesson here is that <em>actions must have triggers</em>.
<ul>
<li>An action by itself is <em>unactionable</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Frame things not just in terms actions, but in terms of what will
trigger you to take action.
<ul>
<li>In this example, instead of “I won’t forget my wallet”, it should be
“As I put on my shoes, I will mentally check that I have brought my
wallet”.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Triggers should be external and obvious.
<ul>
<li>They should work without you having to constantly remind yourself
that you need to take the action.</li>
<li>E.g. “When it is 5pm” is not a good trigger, unless you have also
set an alarm for that time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Triggers should be specific.
<ul>
<li>Reusing the previous example, “As I put on my shoes…” is a better
trigger than “As I get ready for work…”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Perhaps if we were to go back to our tennis example, our system might
look like this (I know nothing about tennis):</p>
<ul>
<li>If I hit a forehand swing, I will hold my raquet in &lt;X&gt;
way.</li>
<li>If I hit a backhand swing, I will hold my raquet in &lt;Y&gt;
way.</li>
<li>After I hit every shot, I will return to the center of the
court.</li>
<li>When serving, if my throw is more than 30cm off, don’t force the
serve.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>(As an aside, notice how this one seems to be more so a list of
trigger and actions, whereas my coding example seemed more like a
flowchart. The way you structure your systems will depend on the
activity and what suits it best. I think trigger and actions work better
for things that require real-time decision making like sports and
gaming, whereas flowcharts and step-by-step processes work better for
more slower and structured processes, like drawing and coding.)</em></p>
<h3 id="how-to-use-your-system">How to Use Your System</h3>
<p>Of course, after making a system, there are also several strategies
that you can use to get the most out of it. Here’s what I’ve come up
with so far that works for me:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Break up your work into small chunks</strong>
<ul>
<li>Each chunk should be relatively small and easy to complete.
<ul>
<li>The length really depends on the task at hand and your own
preferences. In my case, for Overwatch, it’s the length of a game. For
coding, it can be the time it takes to understand a single concept. For
drawing, it can sometimes be upwards of 3-4 hours.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The point is to have short, repeatable sections of work where you
practice the same skill over and over with feedback (self-directed or
otherwise).
<ul>
<li>It is literally the first thing in Veritasium’s Video <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eW6Eagr9XA">The 4 things it takes
to be an expert</a> (the other 3 things are super useful to understand
as well, big recommend!)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Read your system before each chunk, and reflect
after</strong>
<ul>
<li>And make a conscious effort while doing what activity it is to
follow the steps outlined in your system.</li>
<li>After the session:
<ul>
<li>Think about what you learned during the session</li>
<li>Think about what you’d like to do differently for next session</li>
<li>Think about whether your system is working, and if there is anything
you’d like to modify about it.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Spaced Repetition</strong>
<ul>
<li>Spaced repetition is a scientifically proven way to review material
in order to move things from level 3 to level 4.
<ul>
<li>The idea is that to commit something to memory, you must review it
many times.</li>
<li>The more you review it, the longer the intervals between reviewing
can be.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There are a couple ways that I’ve found that help me do this, though
I’m sure there can be others as well:
<ol type="1">
<li>Using <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>
<ul>
<li>This is a flashcard app that automatically works out the optimal
time to make you review a flashcard. Once again, based off the principle
of spaced reptition</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Having a log / journal
<ul>
<li>The idea is that every time you write down your new findings for the
day, you spend just a couple minutes just to check your findings from
last time as well. This effectively simulates spaced repetition.</li>
<li>For Overwatch, I have a text document where I write down lessons
after every game.</li>
<li>For drawing, I have a private chat with just me where I post the
day’s progress to myself, and then write down the things that I can
improve about it.</li>
<li>For general life stuff, I have a label titled “Thoughts” in the
Google Keeps note taking app, where I just write whatever insights I’ve
made into self-improvement / learning.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Talking with friends
<ul>
<li>After you’ve learnt something, talk about it to someone who is
interested.</li>
<li>Framing your experiences or the thing you learnt in an interesting
or funny way can be a great opportunity to cement your
understanding.</li>
<li>Not to mention that your friend may ask questions that prompt you to
do further research yourself.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>So returning to our tennis example once more, before every session,
we’ll have a look at our system, making sure to read every dot point. As
we play, we’ll focus on implementing each step in the process. It’s okay
if we falter and forget, in fact it’s normal and to be expected. As long
as each time we keep centering ourselves once more on our system, we are
guaranted at least a certain level of results as we play. Afterwards,
when we aren’t caught up in the middle of a game, we’ll take some time
to reflect on how we did for the day, what parts of the system worked
well, and what didn’t. We write down these thoughts, and review them at
the beginning of the next session. Over time, we will find that
following the system becomes more and more second nature, and thus we
can safely graduate the parts of the system that we’ve internalise. In
their place, we’ll replace them with deeper nuance into skills that we
seek to understand more thoroughly.</p>

<p>I definitely felt a little more rambly during this article, so
congratulations on making it all the way through! As with all my blog
posts, I’ll finish by encouraging you to reflect on how you can apply
this to your own life. Choose an activity that you are currently trying
to improve at. How might a system benefit some aspect or subskill that
you are working on?</p>
