<p>For our first challenge of Tutor CTF, we have a nice and simple
warmup. We’re given a <code>file.txt</code>, with the following
inside:</p>
<pre><code>NDM0ZjRkNTA3YjQ5NWY2ODRmNzA0NTVmNzkzMDc1NWY0MTUyMzM1Zjc3NjE3MjZkNjU2NDVmMzI1ZjY2Njk2ZTY0NWY2ZDMwNzI0NTVmNDYzMTYxNjc3MzIxN2Q=</code></pre>
<p>Given that all the characters are either upper and lower case letters
and numbers, and the fact that it ends with an equals sign, this is
almost certainly base 64. Hence we can run</p>
<div class="sourceCode">
<pre class="sourceCode term"><code class="sourceCode term"><span><span class="ex">$</span> base64 --decode < file.txt > file2.txt
</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>to decode it. This gives us a new file containing the following:</p>
<pre><code>434f4d507b495f684f70455f7930755f4152335f7761726d65645f325f66696e645f6d3072455f4631616773217d</code></pre>
<p>Looking at this, we have alot of values from 41 to 5A, as well as 61
to 7B, which immediately tell us that this is ASCII. We can use the
<code>xxd</code> command to decode this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode">
<pre class="sourceCode term"><code class="sourceCode term"><span><span class="ex">$</span> xxd -r -p < flag.txt
</span><span>COMP{REDACTED}
</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>The <code>-r -p</code> flags tell xxd to convert from raw hexadecimal
back into ASCII. Running this gets us the flag. Hopefully that wasn’t
too bad :)</p>
