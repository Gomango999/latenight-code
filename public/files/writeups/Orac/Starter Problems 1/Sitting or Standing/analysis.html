<p>Let n be the number of people coming to the concert. The total number of seats in the venue is <span class="MATH">rs</span>. There are two cases we have to consider. If there are more people than the total number of seats, the number of sitting people is equal to <span class="MATH">rs</span> while the number of standing people is <span class="MATH">n-rc</span>. On the other hand, if there are less people than the total number of seats, the number of sitting people is equal to <span class="MATH">n</span>, and the number of standing people is equal to <span class="MATH">rs</span></p>
<!-- I'd really like to write this in mark down. It would make the maths notation much easier to read. -->
