In order to find the minimum area rectangle, we observe that the lowest upper edge we can get must be in line with the top-most hole. Similarly, the highest bottom edge must be the bottom-most hole, the left-most right edge must be on the right-most hole, and the right-most left edge must be on the left-most hole. Hence, this problem simply becomes a problem of finding the minimum and maximum $x$ and $y$ coordinates, and using them to construct the sides of the rectangle. Afterwards, we can trivially calculate the area. The complexity is $O(N)$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#define MAXN 100005

int main () {
    freopen("artin.txt", "r", stdin);
    freopen("artout.txt", "w", stdout);

    int N;
    cin >> N;

    // the edges of our rectangle
    int u = 0;
    int d = INT_MAX;
    int l = INT_MAX;
    int r = 0;

    // find the min and max of the x and y coordinates separately
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        int x, y;
        cin >> x >> y;
        u = max(u, y);
        d = min(d, y);
        l = min(l, x);
        r = max(r, x);
    }
    // u,d,l,r now define the four sides of our rectangle

    // print out the area
    int area = (r - l) * (u - d);
    printf("%d\n", area);
}
```
