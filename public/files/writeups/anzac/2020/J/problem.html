<p> Think the problem was something like this idk: </p>
<p> You have a bunch of judges and they all take some time to score a test.
Each judge has different time to judge in milliseconds, so we want to know the
min amount of full seconds we will need to judge all everything, after
multiplying everything by the variable s, which is given somehow. </p>

<p> Input:
You get your input like this probably:
5 10
120
123
255
234
23 </p>

<p> Sample output:
It's basic maths. Calculate it yourself.
