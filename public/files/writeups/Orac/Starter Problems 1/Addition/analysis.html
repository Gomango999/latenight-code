<p> This problem tests some basic programming skills, such as </p>
<ul>
    <li>Reading and writing to a file</li>
    <li>Scanning in input</li>
    <li>Adding two variables together and storing the result</li>
    <li>Printing out the value of a variable</li>
</ul>
<p> If you had trouble doing this, don't be discouraged! Make sure you study each of the items in the list and understand them all. Here is an example implementation in c++.</p>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-c++">#include <cstdio>
int main () {
    freopen("addin.txt", "r", stdin);
    freopen("addout.txt", "w", stdout);
    int a, b;
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    printf("%d\n", a + b);
}</code></pre>
