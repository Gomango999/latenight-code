Even aside from the rain and wind it hadn't been a happy practice session. Fred and George, who had been spying on the Slytherin team, had seen for themselves the speed of those new Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones. They reported that the Slytherin team was no more than seven greenish blurs, shooting through the air like missiles.

As Harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebody who looked just as preoccupied as he was. Nearly Headless Nick, the ghost of Gryffindor Tower, was staring morosely out of a window, muttering under his breath, ". . . don't fulfill their requirements . . . half an inch, if that . . ."

"Hello, Nick," said Harry.

## Code Block
This is some `inline[0]` code.
Here is some cpp code
```{.cpp .numberLines}
#include <cstdio>
int main () {
    printf("Hello World!\n");
}
```
Here is some python code
```python
print("Hello World!")
```

## Lists
Here are my famous patented lists

- item 2
    - sub item 1
    - sub item 2
- item 3

## Latex
And finally, displaying some maths. Here is some inline maths: $k$, $S$, $A_i$, $\lim_{t \to \infty} f(t)$, $\sum_{i=1}^n i^2$, $(P \cup Q)^c$. Next up, here is some display maths
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$
I hope it pleases you greatly.
