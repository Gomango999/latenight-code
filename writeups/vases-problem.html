<p>
You have bought <span class="MATH">N</span> identical flowers to arrange into three vases. As an expert in interior design,
there are three important rules you must follow:

</p><ol>
	<li>Every flower must go into one of the three vases, since throwing flowers away is wasteful.</li>
	<li>Each vase must contain at least one flower, since an empty vase looks very odd.</li>
	<li>Each vase must contain a different number of flowers, so all the vases look different.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Your task is to determine a possible way to arrange the flowers. Note that there may be multiple
possible solutions, or none at all.

</p><p>
</p><h2>Input</h2>

<p>
The only line of input will contain a single integer: the number of flowers <span class="MATH">N</span>.

</p><p>
</p><h2>Output</h2>

<p>
Your program should output three space-separated integers, describing how many flowers to put
into each vase. If there are multiple possible ways to arrange the flowers, any will do.

</p><p>
If it is impossible to place flowers according to the rules, print <tt>0 0 0</tt> instead.

</p><p>
</p><h2>Sample Input 1</h2>

<pre>15
</pre>

<p>
</p><h2>Sample Output 1</h2>

<pre>4 5 6
</pre>

<p>
</p><h2>Sample Input 2</h2>

<pre>105
</pre>

<p>
</p><h2>Sample Output 2</h2>

<pre>100 2 3
</pre>

<p>
</p><h2>Sample Input 3</h2>

<pre>4
</pre>

<p>
</p><h2>Sample Output 3</h2>

<pre>0 0 0
</pre>

<p>
</p><h2>Explanation</h2>

<p>
In the first sample input, you have <span class="MATH">N = 15</span> flowers. One way you can arrange the flowers is to put
4 flowers in the first vase, 5 flowers in the second vase and 6 flowers in the third vase. There are other possible solutions.

</p><p>
In the second sample input, you have <span class="MATH">N = 105</span> flowers. One way you can arrange the flowers
is to put 100 flowers in the first vase, 2 flowers in the second vase and 3 flowers in the third vase.
There are other possible solutions.

</p><p>
In the third sample input, you have <span class="MATH">N = 4</span> flowers. It is impossible to arrange flowers in vases
according to your interior design rules, so the only correct output is <tt>0 0 0</tt>.

</p><p>
</p><h2>Subtasks &amp; Constraints</h2>

<p>
For all cases, <span class="MATH">1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000</span>.

</p><p>

</p><ul>
<li>
	<p>
	For Subtask 1 (20 marks), <span class="MATH">N = 10</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>Hint:</i> There is only one test case in this subtask, so try working out the answer by hand.
	</p>
</li>
<li>
	<p>
	For Subtask 2 (30 marks), <span class="MATH">N = 1000</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>Hint:</i> There is only one test case in this subtask, so try working out the answer by hand.
	</p>
</li>
<li>
	<p>
	For Subtask 3 (35 marks), <span class="MATH">N ≥ 1000</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>Hint:</i> Can you modify your answer for <span class="MATH">N = 1000</span> to work for larger values of <span class="MATH">N</span>?
	</p>
</li>
<li>
	<p>
	For Subtask 4 (15 marks), no further constraints apply.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>Hint:</i> Think about when it is impossible to arrange the flowers.
	</p>
</li>
